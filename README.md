# Tic-Tac-Toe Game:

## A How-to Guide:


This guide explains how to play a Tic-Tac-Toe game with a 10-second challenge and additional features.

## Gameplay

1. **Players:** Two players take turns.  The first player uses "X," and the second player uses "O."

2. **Objective:** The goal is to be the first to get three of your marks (either "X" or "O") in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

3. **Turns:** Players take turns placing their mark in an empty square on the 3x3 grid.

4. **Time Limit:** Each player has 10 seconds to make their move. A "ding" sound will alert you when 4 seconds remain.

5. **Draw:** If all squares are filled, and neither player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.

6. **Winning:** When a player gets three marks in a row, they win the game.  The winner should press the "Bravo" button. Upon clicking the "Restart" button, a "Congratulations" message will appear.
